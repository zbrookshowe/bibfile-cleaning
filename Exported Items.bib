	abstract = {Anisotropic anomalous dust diffusion in microgravity dusty plasma is investigated using experimental data from the Plasmakristall-4 (PK-4) facility on board the International Space Station. The PK-4 experiment uses video cameras to track individual dust particles, which allows for the collection of large amounts of statistical information on the dust particle positions and velocities. In Paper I of this paper, these statistics were used to quantify anomalous dust diffusion caused by anisotropies in the plasma-mediated dust–dust interactions in PK-4. Here, we use scaling relations to convert statistical parameters extracted from data into input parameters for a Hamiltonian spectral model. The kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian (modeling anomalous diffusion) is informed from the dust displacement distribution functions, while the potential energy term (modeling stochasticity) is informed from fluctuations in the dust positions. The spectrum of energy states for each Hamiltonian is studied to assess probability for extended states (i.e., a continuous portion of the spectrum). The spectral model shows that the combination of nonlocality and stochasticity leads to high probability for transport at certain scales in Hilbert space, which coincide with the characteristic spatial scales of dust particle jumps observed in the experiments. Finally, we discuss how this spectral approach is generalizable to many complex systems, such as electron transport in 2D materials where statistical models are not feasible.},
