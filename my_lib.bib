	abstract = {For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the “alphabet” used to describe those systems.},

	abstract = {Dust grains have been used as minimally invasive probes to determine plasma parameters including the plasma density, temperature, and electric field in a plasma discharge. However, the dust grains in a plasma generate local potential disturbances due to the collection of charge and the subsequent electrostatic interactions between the dust and charged plasma particles. Dust grains in close proximity to one another exhibit interesting non-reciprocal interactions and self-organize into structures such as one-dimensional filamentary chains, two-dimensional “zigzags,” and three-dimensional helices, among others. The formation of these structures suggests that although the dust grains may be less invasive than traditional plasma probes, the disturbance to the local plasma environment introduced by dust grains is non-trivial. Commonly used analytic forms of the electric potential describing complex plasmas have failed to resolve the near-dust region, and as a result are insufficient to provide insight about the formation of complex dust structures. Here, we use an N-body simulation to compute the electric potential from ion densities near various dust grain configurations. We provide an alternative description to the standard analytic model for the electric potential of dust and ion wakes based on a Gaussian shaped cloud of ions. The electric potential obtained from simulations is used to identify minimum energy configurations for two and three dust grains. It is further demonstrated that the minimum potential region identified for N dust grains and their associated ion wakes does not predict the minimum-energy configuration of N + 1 dust grains.},

	abstract = {Dusty plasmas are electrically quasi-neutral media that, along with electrons, ions, neutral gas, radiation, and electric and/or magnetic fields, also contain solid or liquid particles with sizes ranging from a few nanometers to a few micrometers. These media can be found in many natural environments as well as in various laboratory setups and industrial applications. As a separate branch of plasma physics, the field of dusty plasma physics was born in the beginning of 1990s at the intersection of the interests of the communities investigating astrophysical and technological plasmas. An additional boost to the development of the field was given by the discovery of plasma crystals leading to a series of microgravity experiments of which the purpose was to investigate generic phenomena in condensed matter physics using strongly coupled complex (dusty) plasmas as model systems. Finally, the field has gained an increasing amount of attention due to its inevitable connection to the development of novel applications ranging from the synthesis of functional nanoparticles to nuclear fusion and from particle sensing and diagnostics to nano-contamination control. The purpose of the present perspectives paper is to identify promising new developments and research directions for the field. As such, dusty plasmas are considered in their entire variety: from classical low-pressure noble-gas dusty discharges to atmospheric pressure plasmas with aerosols and from rarefied astrophysical plasmas to dense plasmas in nuclear fusion devices. Both fundamental and application aspects are covered.},

Sparsity facilitates exploring high-dimensional spaces while finding parsimonious and interpretable solutions.

The physical idea of the method is that the applied field induces ion flow which distorts the Debye spheres of the compensating plasma charges surrounding microparticles and thus changes the interparticle interactions. To investigate the resulting interactions, we use a self-consistent kinetic description for ions with the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook ion-neutral collision integral. The analysis shows a variety of interaction classes including positive and negative dipolar interactions, triaxially anisotropic interactions, and isotropic interactions of molecular type (i.e., consisting of a repulsion at short distances and an attraction at larger distances). This technique will make it possible to use three-dimensional complex plasmas as realistic model systems for studying the atomistic dynamics of fluids, including liquid-vapor phase transitions and the behavior near the critical point.},

We applied an SVM classification method based on image brightness to locate the interface in a binary complex plasma.

            Nonlinear frequency response analysis is a widely used method for determining system dynamics in the presence of nonlinearities. In dusty plasmas, the plasma–grain interaction (e.g. grain charging fluctuations) can be characterized by a single-particle non-linear response analysis, while grain–grain non-linear interactions can be determined by a multi-particle non-linear response analysis. Here a machine learning-based method to determine the equation of motion in the non-linear response analysis for dust particles in plasmas is presented. Searching the parameter space in a Bayesian manner allows an efficient optimization of the parameters needed to match simulated non-linear response curves to experimentally measured non-linear response curves.},

	abstract = {Regularized regression problems are ubiquitous in statistical modeling, signal processing, and machine learning. Sparse regression in particular has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a broad framework for sparse relaxed regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: (1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning, (2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations, and (3) the methods apply to composite regularizers such as total variation (TV) and its nonconvex variants. We demonstrate the advantages of SR3 (computational efficiency, higher accuracy, faster convergence rates, greater flexibility) across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including applications in compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion, TV regularization, and group sparsity. To promote reproducible research, we also provide a companion MATLAB package that implements these examples.},

	abstract = {In this work we study the asymptotic consistency of the weak-form sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm (WSINDy) in the identification of differential equations from noisy samples of solutions. We prove that the WSINDy estimator is unconditionally asymptotically consistent for a wide class of models which includes the Navier-Stokes equations and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We thus provide a mathematically rigorous explanation for the observed robustness to noise of weak-form equation learning. Conversely, we also show that in general the WSINDy estimator is only conditionally asymptotically consistent, yielding discovery of spurious terms with probability one if the noise level is above some critical threshold and the nonlinearities exhibit sufficiently fast growth. We derive explicit bounds on the critical noise threshold in the case of Gaussian white noise and provide an explicit characterization of these spurious terms in the case of trigonometric and/or polynomial model nonlinearities. However, a silver lining to this negative result is that if the data is suitably denoised (a simple moving average filter is sufficient), then we recover unconditional asymptotic consistency on the class of models with locally-Lipschitz nonlinearities. Altogether, our results reveal several important aspects of weak-form equation learning which may be used to improve future algorithms. We demonstrate our results numerically using the Lorenz system, the cubic oscillator, a viscous Burgers growth model, and a Kuramoto-Sivashinsky-type higher-order PDE.},

            Machine learning offers an intriguing alternative to first-principle analysis for discovering new physics from experimental data. However, to date, purely data-driven methods have only proven successful in uncovering physical laws describing simple, low-dimensional systems with low levels of noise. Here we demonstrate that combining a data-driven methodology with some general physical principles enables discovery of a quantitatively accurate model of a non-equilibrium spatially extended system from high-dimensional data that is both noisy and incomplete. We illustrate this using an experimental weakly turbulent fluid flow where only the velocity field is accessible. We also show that this hybrid approach allows reconstruction of the inaccessible variables – the pressure and forcing field driving the flow.},

The charging and dynamics of the grains are coupled and derived from the ion–dust interactions, allowing for detailed analysis of the ion wakefield structure and wakefield-mediated interaction as the dust particles change position. When a downstream grain oscillates vertically within the wake, it decharges by up to 30\% as it approaches the upstream grain and then recharges as it recedes. There is an apparent hysteresis in charging depending on whether the grain is approaching or receding from a region of higher ion density. Maps of the ion-mediated dust–dust interaction force show that the radial extent of the wake region, which provides an attractive restoring force on the downstream particle, increases as the ion flow velocity decreases, though the restoring effect becomes weaker. As also shown in recent numerical results, there is no net attractive vertical force between the two grains. Instead, the reduced ion drag on the downstream particle allows it to “draft” in the wakefield of the upstream particle.},

	abstract = {Self-organization of dust grains into stable filamentary dust structures (or “chains”) largely depends on dynamic interactions between individual charged dust grains and complex electric potential arising from the distribution of charges within a local plasma environment. Recent studies have shown that the positive column of the gas discharge plasma in the Plasmakristall-4 (PK-4) experiment at the International Space Station supports the presence of fast-moving ionization waves, which lead to variations of plasma parameters by up to an order of magnitude from the average background values. The highly variable environment resulting from ionization waves may have interesting implications for the dynamics and self-organization of dust particles, particularly concerning the formation and stability of dust chains. Here, we investigate the electric potential surrounding dust chains in the PK-4 experiment by employing a molecular dynamics model of the dust and ions with boundary conditions supplied by a particle-in-cell with Monte Carlo collision simulation of the ionization waves. The model is used to examine the effects of the plasma conditions within different regions of the ionization wave and compare the resulting dust structure to that obtained by employing the time-averaged plasma conditions. The comparison between simulated dust chains and experimental data from the PK-4 experiment shows that the time-averaged plasma conditions do not accurately reproduce observed results for dust behavior, indicating that more careful treatment of plasma conditions in the presence of ionization waves is required. It is further shown that commonly used analytic forms of the electric potential do not accurately describe the electric potential near charged dust grains under these plasma conditions.},

          , 
            We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg–de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the filamentary structural states of microgravity dusty plasma using data from the Plasmakristall-4 (PK-4) facility on board the International Space Station. The dust particles in the PK-4 discharge are observed to form field-aligned filaments and nested (layered) structures in response to changes in the plasma conditions, neutral gas pressure, and externally applied electric field. This work explores the possibility that these filamentary dusty plasmas exhibit properties of liquid crystals. The structural characteristics of the dust clouds are studied for nine sets of pressure-current conditions using pair correlation functions calculated for particles (i) within individual filaments, (ii) within the central plane of the dust cloud, and (iii) within successive planes of the cloud (the 3D cloud). It is observed that, at low pressure (\${\textbackslash}approx\$30 Pa), the entire cloud is in a weakly crystalline state with similar coupling of particles within filaments and among neighboring filaments. At high pressure (\${\textbackslash}approx\$70 Pa), the order within filaments improves (enhanced crystalline behavior), while the degree of freedom of filaments to move with respect to each other increases (enhanced liquid behavior). Since neutral gas pressure in dusty plasma acts as inverse temperature, we argue that the structural changes observed with increasing pressure are analogous to a transition to a nematic liquid crystal state. It is further observed that the filaments exhibit alignment in nested surfaces for several pressure-current conditions, suggesting the possibility of a smectic liquid crystal state. These results are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations of the dust and ions using the DRIAD (Dynamic Response of Ions And Dust) code.},

	abstract = {Using the machine learning method, the screening parameter κ and the coupling parameter Γ of two-dimensional (2D) dusty plasma are determined simultaneously purely from position fluctuations of individual particles using both simulation and experiment data. To train, validate, and test convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Langevin dynamical simulations are performed with different κ and Γ values to obtain position fluctuation data of individual particles. From the test with the simulation data, the trained CNNs are able to accurately determine the values of κ and Γ simultaneously, with the typically averaged mean relative error varying between 10 \% and 17 \%. While using the trained CNN with the 2D dusty plasma experiment data, the distribution of the determined κNN or ΓNN values always exhibits one prominent peak, and the peak locations well agree with the κ and Γ values determined from the widely accepted phonon spectra fitting method. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that, using machine learning methods, the two global characterization parameters of κ and Γ in 2D dusty plasmas are able to be accurately determined simultaneously purely from the position fluctuations of local individual particles.},

	abstract = {We have performed experiments on dusty plasmas under the weightlessness conditions of parabolic flights where the dust particles form an extended homogeneous dust cloud. The three-dimensional (3D) dynamic state of the dust cloud is characterized. Therefore, the particle trajectories have been recorded using a four-camera stereoscopic camera system. From that, the 3D particle trajectories have been determined using both a machine-learning particle reconstruction technique and the deterministic shake-the-box algorithm. From the trajectories, characteristic fluid parameters, such as flow fields and finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE)-based fluid structures have been calculated and analyzed. The FTLE analysis indicates that the fluid is characterized by an incompressible flow with small-scale behavior. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the machine-learning based approach allows to reliably characterize the dynamic states by comparison with the shake-the-box algorithm.

Fast Fourier transform is used to reveal how U-Net, a deep convolutional neural network developed for non-plasma applications, achieves the improvements for noisy scenes.

Despite recent advances in training neural networks to solve complex tasks, deep learning approaches to symbolic regression are underexplored. We propose a framework that leverages deep learning for symbolic regression via a simple idea: use a large model to search the space of small models. Specifically, we use a recurrent neural network to emit a distribution over tractable mathematical expressions and employ a novel risk-seeking policy gradient to train the network to generate better-fitting expressions. Our algorithm outperforms several baseline methods (including Eureqa, the gold standard for symbolic regression) in its ability to exactly recover symbolic expressions on a series of benchmark problems, both with and without added noise. More broadly, our contributions include a framework that can be applied to optimize hierarchical, variable-length objects under a black-box performance metric, with the ability to incorporate constraints in situ, and a risk-seeking policy gradient formulation that optimizes for best-case performance instead of expected performance.},

	abstract = {Dusty plasma is a mixture of ions, electrons, and macroscopic charged particles that is commonly found in space and planetary environments. The particles interact through Coulomb forces mediated by the surrounding plasma, and as a result, the effective forces between particles can be nonconservative and nonreciprocal. Machine learning (ML) models are a promising route to learn these complex forces, yet their structure should match the underlying physical constraints to provide useful insight. Here, we demonstrate and experimentally validate an ML approach that incorporates physical intuition to infer force laws in a laboratory dusty plasma. Trained on 3D particle trajectories, the model accounts for inherent symmetries, nonidentical particles, and learns the effective nonreciprocal forces between particles with exquisite accuracy (R 0.99). We validate the model by inferring particle masses in two independent yet consistent ways. The model’s accuracy enables precise measurements of particle charge and screening length, identifying large deviations from common theoretical assumptions. Our ability to identify unknown physics from experimental data demonstrates how ML-powered approaches can guide new routes of scientific discovery in many-body systems. Furthermore, we anticipate our ML approach to be a starting point for inferring laws from dynamics in a wide range of many-body systems, from colloids to living organisms.},

The particle interaction energy is addressed by two different approaches: (i) using the dynamically screened wake potential for small Mach numbers derived by Kompaneets et al., in 2016, and (ii) introducing effect of polarization of the trapped ion cloud by discharge electric fields. Is is found that both approaches yield the particle interaction energy which is independent of the operational discharge mode. In the parameter space of the performed experiments, the first approach can provide onset of the particle attraction and string formation only at gas pressures higher than 40–45 Pa, whilst the mechanism based on the trapped ion effect yields attraction in the experimentally important pressure range 20–40 Pa and may reconcile theory and observations.},

Calculations have typically neglected collisions, on the grounds that the mean free path is long compared to the Debye length. However, it has long been suspected that negative-energy trapped ions, created by occasional collisions, could be important. This paper presents self-consistent analytic calculations of the density and distribution function of trapped and untrapped ions, the potential profile, the ion and electron current to the collector, and the floating potential and charge of the collector. Under typical conditions for dust grains immersed in a discharge plasma, trapped ions are found to dominate the shielding near the grain, substantially increase the ion current to the grain, and suppress the floating potential and grain charge, even when the mean free path is much greater than the Debye length.},

A superthermal ion drift in an external electric field could be realized in a future microgravity experiment with complex plasmas proposed for the ISS. In this case, the MD simulation presented here predicts a crossover transition from a string fluid to an isotropic system if the AC field is turned into a DC field.

	abstract = {Abstract
            There is a variety of cases in nature when the action–reaction symmetry is broken. In particular, suitable conditions for this are realized in colloidal suspensions and complex plasmas. Since the first theories and simulations of the nonreciprocal effective interactions between microparticles in complex plasmas were published in 1995–1996, there have been hundreds of studies in the theoretical development of this theme. However, despite such a rich theoretical background, one of the important unsolved problems is a direct experimental determination of the nonreciprocal interparticle interaction forces. Here, we studied experimentally in detail the forces of the nonreciprocal effective interaction between microparticles suspended a radio-frequency produced plasma sheath. For this purpose, an experimental method based on an analysis of the spectral density of random processes in an open dissipative two-particle system was developed. In contrast to previous investigations, the proposed method takes into account random and dissipative processes in the system, does not require a special design of the experimental setup and any external perturbations, pre-measurements of external fields and any assumptions about the type of interaction. We found that even small charge changes of one particle, caused by its thermal motion in a wake field of another particle, can lead to a significant change in the effective (measurable) interaction between the particles.},

A striking phenomenon is the isotropic-to-string transition observed in electrorheological complex plasma under the influence of a symmetric ion wake field. Such transitions have been investigated using the Plasma Kristall-4 (PK-4) microgravity laboratory on the International Space Station. Recent experiments and numerical simulations have shown that, under PK-4-relevant discharge conditions, the seemingly homogeneous direct current discharge column is highly inhomogeneous, with large axial electric field oscillations associated with ionization waves occurring on microsecond time scales. A multi-scale numerical model of the dust–plasma interactions is employed to investigate the role of the electric field in the charge of individual dust grains, the ion wake field and the order of string-like structures. Results are compared with those for dust strings formed in similar conditions in the PK-4 experiment.},

	abstract = {Accurate interaction potentials between microscopic components such as colloidal particles or cells are crucial to understanding a range of processes, including colloidal crystallization, bacterial colony formation, and cancer metastasis. Even in systems where the precise interaction mechanisms are unknown, effective interactions can be measured to inform simulation and design. However, these measurements are difficult and time-intensive, and often require conditions that are drastically different from  conditions of the system of interest. Moreover, existing methods of measuring interparticle potentials rely on constraining a small number of particles at equilibrium, placing limits on which interactions can be measured. We introduce a method for inferring interaction potentials directly from trajectory data of interacting particles. We explicitly solve the equations of motion to find a form of the potential that maximizes the probability of observing a known trajectory. Our method is valid for systems both in and out of equilibrium, is well-suited to large numbers of particles interacting in typical system conditions, and does not assume a functional form of the interaction potential. We apply our method to infer the interactions of colloidal spheres from experimental data, successfully extracting the range and strength of a depletion interaction from the motion of the particles.},

In Paper I of this paper, these statistics were used to quantify anomalous dust diffusion caused by anisotropies in the plasma-mediated dust–dust interactions in PK-4. Here, we use scaling relations to convert statistical parameters extracted from data into input parameters for a Hamiltonian spectral model. The kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian (modeling anomalous diffusion) is informed from the dust displacement distribution functions, while the potential energy term (modeling stochasticity) is informed from fluctuations in the dust positions. The spectrum of energy states for each Hamiltonian is studied to assess probability for extended states (i.e., a continuous portion of the spectrum). The spectral model shows that the combination of nonlocality and stochasticity leads to high probability for transport at certain scales in Hilbert space, which coincide with the characteristic spatial scales of dust particle jumps observed in the experiments. Finally, we discuss how this spectral approach is generalizable to many complex systems, such as electron transport in 2D materials where statistical models are not feasible.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present the first experimental observation of a triple point in a strongly coupled complex plasma medium. Initially, a 2D crystalline structure of the dust component consisting of monodisperse micrometer-sized particles is created. The evolution of this monolayer as a function of the discharge voltage is then investigated and, in the course of this evolution, the co-existence of three distinct phases of the system consisting of a liquid region and two crystalline regions with square and hexagonal lattice configurations is observed. Two different transition sequences are identified in the system, depending on the initial dust density of the monolayer. The particles in the fluid region have high kinetic energy. Before the emergence of a triple state, it is found that the particles in the different lattice geometries show different in-plane or out-of-plane oscillations. It is conjectured that a complex or mixed instability that originates in the system in a localized manner gives rise to the formation of the triple point in our experiments.},

	abstract = {The interaction between charged dust grains and streaming plasma leads to the formation of ion wakes, which are thought to be responsible for the self-organization of dust into complex structures. These structures have been observed to exhibit long-range stability both in ground-based and microgravity experiments. The response of dust in complex plasma to changes in experimental conditions is similar to the atomic-level ordering in traditional materials, but occurs at more easily observable spatial and temporal scales due to the larger dust grain size. The purpose of this work is to expand the current understanding of stable configurations of dust grains in a streaming plasma environment by implementing a molecular dynamics simulation that models dust and ions on their individual timescales. The model is used to determine plasma parameters that are currently unable to be directly measured experimentally and quantify their impact on dust structures, to compare and evaluate existing theoretical models of electric potential and resulting interactions between charged dust grains, and to quantify plasma conditions that lead to transitions between stable configurations of dust.},

	abstract = {The use of low-dimensional dynamical systems as reduced models for plasma dynamics is useful as solving an initial value problem requires much less computational resources than fluid simulations. We utilize a data-driven modeling approach to identify a reduced model from simulation data of a convection problem. A convection model with a pressure source centered at the inner boundary models the edge dynamics of a magnetically confined plasma. The convection problem undergoes a sequence of bifurcations as the strength of the pressure source increases. The time evolution of the energies of the pressure profile, the turbulent flow, and the zonal flow capture the fundamental dynamic behavior of the full system. By applying the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method, we identify a predator-prey type dynamical system that approximates the underlying dynamics of the three energy state variables. A bifurcation analysis of the system reveals consistency between the bifurcation structures, observed for the simulation data, and the identified underlying system.},

	abstract = {A plasma glow discharge tube, a versatile device widely employed in several scientific and industrial applications, is also a useful tool for many basic plasma studies in the laboratory. Anode glow oscillations are well-known phenomena in such devices that arise from an instability of the plasma glow around a small positively charged electrode. Depending upon the gas pressure, the applied DC voltage, and the distance between the electrodes, these oscillations can display a rich dynamical behavior. Over a certain parametric regime, these nonlinear oscillations exhibit a stable limit cycle behavior that has been modeled in the past by a Van der Pol like equation. While such a model equation provides a qualitative description of the observations, it lacks quantitative agreement and does not have any predictive capability. We employ the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to obtain a model equation directly from a time series of the experimental data. Our model captures well the main features of the experimental data in a quantitative manner. It also shows a significant deviation from the Van der Pol model due to additional contributions that are akin to nonlinear damping in a Rayleigh oscillator. Such a hybrid Van der Pol–Rayleigh oscillator model could provide a useful paradigm for future explorations of the nonlinear dynamics of this system.},
